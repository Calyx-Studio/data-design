		<h1>Use Case & Interaction</h1>
		<p>Mamma Mia has had an extremely busy day. The kids are getting restless and she still hasn't gotten much of her research done. Her partner is out of town and she needs a few hours of uninterrupted time.</p>

	<p>Mia logs into Netflix and begins by searching for educational content from the search icon. She finds and selects 3 age appropriate, education shows and adds to "My List". Mia clicks on the first show to begin playing shows in sequence.
